            <p class="paragraph">Travelling by train in General compartment with Earphones in ears, Nikhil was thoughtless... the carefree attitude was visible to many as his bag lay on the side unattended almost ready to leap out of train and land in lap of some oppurtunist. The Train came to a screeching sudden halt and the peacefullness of this individual was jolted with the sudden jerk to his earbuds and he was back to reality. A reality full of chaos and restlessness, Nikhil immediately looks for his bag which is still lying there but is not at a distance and seems someone has tampered with it.</p>
            <p>The thought process starts a new thread this time. The thread is not peacefull and definitely not carefree, the mere thought of someone trying to tamper with his luggage has him gripped in fear by his legs. Nikhil wakes up and starts going through the luggage. The bag is okay, all the things are safe and accounted for, the uncle in front of him advices him to be carefull and keep an eye on his luggage.</p>
            <p>Nikhil listens to the uncle with utmost sincerity and acknowledges his advice, the train is again started to move and the earphones are plugged in, Nikhil starts to humm his song and jumps into a mild sleep.</p>
            <p>Unknown time has passed by and nikhil is suddenly wokenup by a jerk from train. He wakes up and sees the uncle in front of him is missing and so is his luggage.</p>
            <p>Another thought process starts in his mind, Is anyone to be trusted in this world or is everyone looking for their own benefit. If everyone is looking for his own benefit, how do people post about people helping each other, does it really happen? or is it just a publicity stunt played for certain benefit.</p>
            <p>The 23 yr Old looks for Guidance and is ready to trust, but will his experience ever let him trust anyone fully again?</p>
